Bags full of green designs by Sanchi

 The thol sanchi or the good-old cloth sling bag has been Zafer Ameer’s constant companion from childhood. Even while pursuing his engineering, he used to carry it occasionally to his college. But he never expected to make a living out of it. That too after quitting his job in Technopark. A few days away from opening the first retail store of his brand, Sanchi, in partnership with long-time friend, Gokul Ratnakar, on October 2, Zafer looks back at his journey with pride. At the tastefully-done space with textured, plastered walls decorated with Warli paintings, bamboo wall cladding, panels and curtains, he says that the decision to start a retail store wasn’t an impetuous one. “Eco-friendly products are often considered costly and unimpressive. So our strategy was to enter the market with trendy, colourful and reasonably-priced bags that also make a style statement. When we opened a wholesale showroom in Kowdiar, we had a lot of retail clients. That’s when I decided to shift to retail business and Gokul came forward to invest in the venture,” he says. Sanchi, which has been around since 2014, caught on when the City Corporation banned plastic carry bags in 2017. “An earlier ban did not have the desired results because there weren’t many convenient alternatives for the plastic carry bags. But, in 2017 eco-friendly, reusable cloth bags were promoted in a big way to replace the non-degradable plastic ones that posed the biggest challenge in solid waste management. We were there at the right place at the right time. In fact, our success inspired many to follow suit,” he says. At present, the Corporation alone runs three cloth bag-making units. From the simple carry bags, Sanchi soon moved on to trendy, colourful, multi-purpose jute and cloth bags, which are available at the new outlet. “New products include laundry bags, yoga mats in cloth and jute, fruit baskets and covers for water cans. With the green protocol gaining acceptance in hotels and resorts, we are getting a lot of orders for eco-friendly products. That’s how we came up with laundry bags and utility pouches,” adds the 30-year-old. Zafer recalls that the first step towards making cloth bags was taken soon after he finished his engineering in computer science. “I was active in a political party and for one of its conferences I had to arrange for low-cost cloth bags. We bought cloth from Madurai and got the bags stitched by a tailor in Venjaramoodu. Although they looked like the bags devotees carry on pilgrimages to Sabarimala, we experimented with colours,” he says. Then came the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) that made Sanchi what it is today. “Having attended several editions of the festival, I noticed that the thol sanchi is usually associated with so-called intellectuals who turn up for the festival! I thought the bags might catch the eye of such customers and so at IFFK 2013, we put up a stall at the festival venue. The entire stock got sold out! The clientèle I got then has been my asset till now. By the next edition of the IFFK, we had a brand name, Sanchi,” he remembers.FACT FILESanchi stocks different kinds of shopping bags, eco-friendly cutlery and so on. The products often make it to conferences and corporate events. A breakthrough for the brand was the Indian History Congress held in 2018, where they supplied jute ID cards and 3,000 jute bags. It also provided 10,000 jute bags at the India-West Indies cricket match held at The Sports Hub at last year. “Last month we supplied laptop bags worth ₹14 lakh at the farmers’ meet of Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) in Hyderabad. Besides our regular units, several households pitched in to finish the work before the deadline,” Zafer says. Sanchi supplies to companies in Technopark and also exports its products. The brand was registered in 2015 and in 2016, the first manufacturing unit, Samanwaya, was opened at Venjaramoodu, with women in the locality coming forward to be a part of it. “Women empowerment has been a motto of Sanchi and instead of investing in one unit, I divide the job among different clusters, thus allowing small-scale units to flourish. Although Sanchi has less than five staff members on its rolls, nearly 40 women are involved in stitching the bags and other products at Kudumbasree units in Alathur and Kozhinjampara in Palakkad district and Chelakkara and Wadakkanchery in Thrissur, besides those at Venjaramoodu (Zafer’s native place), and near Pollachi in Tamil Nadu,” he says.Meanwhile, in 2017, he put in his papers. “I had been juggling my job and business until then. But when the Corporation announced a total ban on plastics, I didn’t want to let go of the chance to make the most of the opportunity. So I decided to quit my job,” he explains. However, instead of accepting his resignation, his employer advised him to go in for a sabbatical. “The management had always encouraged my initiative and, often, Sanchi bags were given away as gifts to international clients. They knew I was taking a big risk and gave me an option to fall back on in case I failed. But I didn’t have to return!” he says. JOINING HANDS“I had met Zafer through common friends. I was impressed by what he was doing and I thought I should be part of the venture,” says Gokul Ratnakar, a law graduate, who also runs Can Walk, a foundation for the rehabilitation of the disabled. The 35-year-old, injured after an accident 13 years ago, plans to open a rehab centre for people using wheelchairs like him Looking ahead, Sanchi hopes to step into “green” event management. “For example, we have jute-based wedding cards stitched with left-over pieces of jute bags. It can be used as table mats as well,” he adds. The brand plans to target school students in the next academic year. “School bags, steel water bottles, notepads with recycled paper, cloth pouches, paper pens and more will be available then,” Zafer says. Having taken a leap of faith by starting Sanchi, how does he look back at his avatar as an entrepreneur? “Exciting! When I left the job there were many in the family who made fun of me saying, avan sanchi vilkkunnu (he is selling cloth bag). But I knew I would succeed and I had to since that was the only way to mute the critics. Now my parents and wife are fully involved in my enterprise and the naysayers have gone silent,” he says.Sanchi is located near Panavila Junction. Contact: 6282967372

Seniors come together to have a ball at the ongoing Golden Fest in Thiruvananthapuram



Participants during a carrom match during Alive Golden Fest   | Photo Credit: 
Special Arrangement  Octogenarian Adithya Varma furrows his brow, racking his brain for the next best move. His “opponent” for the day, 62-year-old Dineshan M R, has just made a clever gambit with his white piece on the chessboard. The two slug it out in a “friendly contest” against the background score of rain at Alive’s recreational room in Pandit’s Colony at Kowdiar. At Alive’s ongoing Golden Fest: A Celebration for Seniors, the participants are out there to prove that age is indeed just a number with a whole lot of fun-filled activities. For them, ‘retirement’ does not necessarily mean retirement from enjoyment. It’s also been an occasion to rub shoulders with “like-minded peers.”“I love chess. I often play it online. But, this time, I’m happy to ‘face off’ with a human,” says Dineshan, a former BSNL employee. For Adithya, a former State-level player, the game has “kept me going” for decades.Open for those above 60, the fête, organised by the ageing solutions company as part of a three-day festival, which kicked off on Thursday, includes badminton, carrom, sudoku, crossword, story-writing, painting contest and so on, perhaps the highlight being the ‘Golden Couple’ contest on Saturday. While some consider it as an opportunity to socialise with people their age, others like G Sundaresan, who participates in carrom and singing, feels “it’s like time-warping back to college days.” “I recently underwent a surgery for cataract and have been confined in my home for a while. I used to play a lot of carrom in college and it feels nice to play a game,” says the 63-year-old, a former banker. The oldest participant is 92-year-old Rama Varma, is trying his luck in the music and story-writing contests.Lalitha Bai, a retired secretariat employee, loves to paint, one reason why she is eagerly looking for the painting contest on Saturday. The 62-year-old says she often experiments with different media and styles such as murals and landscape and “one-stroke greeting cards.” For Rajani Chandran, a former professor with College of Agriculture, Vellayani, writing is a passion. She has brought out a few books for the State Resource Centre, while some of her stories have appeared in vernacular magazines. Come Saturday, she will be picking up the pen again for the story-writing contest in Malayalam.It’s not just about artistic expressions and creativity, there’s room to work some of the gray matter too, something 69-year-old Vijaya Prem is looking forward to with the Sudoku competition. “In my family, there have been incidents of dementia and I have been told that playing Sudoku is good for the brain. I have been solving them for the past 10 years. Also, at this age, you have to find your own entertainment, right?,” asks the Mumbai native who’s settled in the city. For 72-year-old crossword enthusiast K T Rajagopalan, who retired as general manager of a bank, his tryst with word puzzles goes back well over 45 years. “Any new crossword is a new challenge for me. My age does not matter,” he says with a laugh.BRB Puthran, co-founder and CEO of Alive: Adding Life to Years, says the idea is to promote “active ageing” and that the Golden Fest attempts to highlight the importance of both mobility and cognitive engagement in old age, done with dash of fun. “The focus is on two-way engagement and that’s the kind of activities we have incorporated as part of the festival,” he points out. The festival is held at the Alive centre, Sree Moolam Club and Hassan Marikar Hall.

Invis Multimedia has been providing digital content for Kerala Tourism for 20 years

special arrangement  Twenty children accompanied by their family members, hailing from different states in India and five countries, will land in Kerala on Friday and Saturday to begin their five-day tour of the State. Winners of the second edition of the Clint Memorial International Painting Competition, conducted by Kerala Tourism for artists between the ages of four and 16, the children will get the opportunity to see the land they had imaginatively picturised to win the top prizes of the contest.

“At each place, they will get an opportunity to interact with local artisans and experience a little of Kerala’s culture. On Monday, they will reach Thiruvananthapuram where they will interact with Kathakali artistes. They can see how the elaborate make-up is done and watch an abridged version of Balivadham,” MR Hari explains enthusiastically. Managing director of Invis Multimedia, which had implemented the concept of a global online painting competition for Kerala Tourism, Hari and his firm have been providing information technology solutions to Kerala Tourism since 1998.How does one encapsulate the attractions of a small state tucked away in a corner of the Indian sub-continent? With great imagination and some stunningly captivating videos, if one were to go by the content created by Invis.Fact file Invis Multimedia was initially christened as India Vision. Later, it was shortened and made Invis.Kerala Tourism comes out with online greetings for festivals such as Vishu, Onam, Ramzan and Christmas. These crisp videos are made by Invis.“It all started when my partner, MR Ajith, and I began a state-of-the-art studio in 1995 in the city to make top-class documentaries and films. We were just out of college and had stars in our eyes. There were a couple of non-resident Indians who invested in our dream and we were in business with veteran mediaperson NRS Babu sir as our chairman. Since I did not have the financial resources, I was responsible for providing intellectual content and ideas,” recalls Hari.

However, when things did not pan out the way they had planned, they decided to make a video, Green Symphony, on Kerala and market it themselves. In 1998, the attractively-packaged interactive CD Rom gave an overview of the attractions of the State and a quick look at its culture and heritage.Around that time, Kerala Tourism had decided to market the state’s tourism potential through IT solutions, videos and CDs and had invited a private firm to make one for the purpose. “However, the video did not live up to the expectations of Kerala Tourism and that is when we decided to try our luck. We were in debt and struggling to stay afloat. Fortunately, Green Symphony, our CD on Kerala, was approved and the government managed to get us some ads and we were able to get through that rough patch. Kerala Tourism, under the helmanship of its then director Dr V Venu, was probably the first state in India to use such videos and IT solutions to promote tourism,” recalls Hari.Since 1998, the firm has been developing the tourism website of the Kerala Tourism. Twenty years and several national and Pacific Asia Travel Awards (PATA) after, Invis Multimedia has notched up an enviable record for generating traffic to the website and coming up with several innovative IT ideas to keep Kerala Tourism in the sun. Drawing inspiration Edmund Thomas Clint (1976-83) was considered a child prodigy. He has been the subject of a number of books in Malayalam and English. In 2017, a Malayalam feature film was made on him.All participants of the contest in Clint’s name will be given certificates.Those who encouraged children to take part in the competition were given awards as ‘promoters’.Children from Russia, Bulgaria, Sri Lanka, Bangaladesh and Zimbabwe are in the group.“We have won seven PATA awards in different categories and seven national awards too. As technology changes, we have managed to keep abreast of those changes. So from video and DVDs to YouTube and mobile WAP, we have developed content for different platforms,” says Hari.He agrees that they probably have the largest collection of videos of Kerala’s performance arts and festivals in different regions of the State and many have subtitles in English to help viewers understand the nuances of the art form.

As Invis evolved, they brought out videos on Ayurveda, e-books, audio collections and so on, thus creating several firsts to their credit. “We also took up Kerala Tourism’s decision to go for live webcasts of festivals like Theyyam in Malabar and Thrissur Pooram and those were huge hits. We developed an app for Kerala Tourism and came up with a toilet survey for travellers in the State. If you are travelling in Kerala and wish to look for a washroom, our app will locate one for you,” he adds.Constant innovation and out-of-the-box ideas to keep up with the concepts of Kerala Tourism have kept the firm on top of the game. Eventually, the NRI investors were bought out and 40 percent of the shares were given to the long-time employees of the firm.“They have also become our partners and, as a result, attrition is low in our company,” says Hari with justifiable pride. He adds Invis today has 70 employees on its rolls and employs freelancers all over the State to provide content.As the firm begins its third decade in the field, Hari points out that within the next three or four years, all the content developed by them is likely to become outdated and it would be time to move on. “It is imperative to keep updating our technology to cater to a new generation of travellers,” says Hari.

SignNEXT speaks for those who see sound

 How do you express Nipah in sign language? The question was from SignNEXT, a Technopark-based start-up, to Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre in New Delhi. The reply: use the sign for ‘N’ and then that for a bat.Theertha Nirmal, Kingsley David and Pravij Kumar P, who helm the start-up, recount the anecdote with amusement. “We needed it for a Nipah awareness video,” says Kingsley, the brain behind the venture formed in 2017 to empower the hearing-challenged. A bank of sign language-based video tutorials, SignSKOOL, for the hearing-challenged, will be rolled out through a mobile application in a couple of months’ time by the firm.

SignNEXT’s CEO Theertha, conversing with the help of an ‘interpreter’, Steffy Nivetha, says the journey started when she was pregnant. “I thought pregnancy was something I could manage like fever or cold! But I was wrong and didn’t know what I should do. I couldn’t understand most of the things my doctor told me,” she recalls, the uneasiness still writ large on her face. YouTube videos too were of little help. “I wished that I had access to some information available in the language I knew, Indian Sign Language (ISL). My husband and I had discussed several ideas to empower the hearing challenged. But we didn’t know how to go about it. That’s when Kingsley came in,” Theertha says.Today, she communicates using ISL on women’s health, pregnancy, nutrition, diet, menstrual hygiene and many other relevant topics. Kingsley says the idea was born at Technopark where he used to work at an MNC on its “innovation and communication programmes.” He explains that he was brought up by his aunt who was hearing challenged and although he is not hearing-challenged, he could empathise with the problems she faced. The MNC had eight hearing-challenged employees, and interactions with them inspired him to do something for the community. Besides an online news channel for them, he launched Talking Hands, an “initiative to break the barrier between the 3,000 employees in the company who could hear and the eight who could not.”It was the launch of cheap 4G services in 2016 that opened a new world for the hearing-challenged as they started forming communities to communicate with each other. “I realised that technology could make things possible for them. Essential services and information are deprived for most of them.Since I knew Theertha and her struggle through her husband, then my colleague, I wanted her to be the face of the venture. My vision was to bring her to the forefront, thus giving hope and inspiration to more people facing different challenges. Pravij joined later,” Kinglsey says. Pravij, an agripreneur, adds: “This is a social cause and that’s why I wanted to be part of it. I knew I could contribute towards the cause.”

Incubated at the Kerala Startup Mission at Technopark, SignNEXT envisages reaching out to the hearing-challenged in multiple ways. SignSKOOL targets women, children and adults. “These videos in ISL covers topics such as antenatal, post-partum and post-pregnancy, menstrual health and hygiene, nutrition for pregnant women, child care, cancer awareness, HIV and the like. The videos have animation, visuals and subtitles,” elaborates Kingsley.Five signers at SignNEXT, all of them hearing-challenged, are the presenters. The plan is to bring out 800 videos on 100 titles. Eighty-nine videos on safe motherhood are ready. “The launch is delayed because of shortage of funds. Social impact start-ups always face this challenge,” Kingsley adds.Short takes Theertha, a native of Perambra in Kozhikode, is married to Sanu P Chukkari, who is also hearing-challenged. They met at the National Institute of Speech and Hearing (NISH) in Thiruvananthapuram, where he was her senior. While Theertha’s parents have no hearing loss, Sanu’s parents are hearing-challenged. “My in-laws take care of our daughter, Eva, who will soon turn two, when we both go to work. She has no disability and can also understand sign language,” she says. SignNEXT team has Renuka Ramesh, a leading sign language interpreter and trainer as its mentor. She helps us translate English into ‘signed English’, which has a different grammatical pattern and then into sign language. The start-up is supported by Social Justice Department, NISH, Directorate of Women and Child Development, National Institute of Nutrition, Kerala Startup Mission, and Technopark, along with UNICEF and World Health Organisation.Another project that has been announced is Deaf Mitra, being introduced in collaboration with the Kerala Police, which would help the hearing-challenged register complaints at police stations. In the long run, the start-up proposes to invite 150 hearing-challenged women from across the country to Kerala, who, in turn, will disseminate information through videos in their villages and isolated communities. Once the videos on health are released, the team plans to focus on education, starting with English-language courses in sign language. The trio says that language acquisition is very poor amongst those with hearing challenges because early intervention doesn’t happen in most cases. “Often, the reading and writing skills of the hearing-challenged population is equivalent to those of children in classes two to five. We are starting with English and will diversify to other languages and vocational training courses,” the team says. While the health-based videos are free, educational videos require subscription.However, the fact is that of the 1.8 crore hearing-challenged in India, nearly 10 lakh are not conversant in sign language. In one of her videos, Theertha says, “Sign language is not an option, it is a human right.” She adds: “I grew up feeling sad and angry about my condition. But all that is past and I am confident now because I can communicate. Being called a CEO is no small feat.”

Watch | Pulikkali: Kerala's 'play of the tigers'


Thrissur saw around 300 tigers, in all possible colours, prancing around at a rollicking show of Pulikkali as a part of the city's Onam celebrations. The term Pulikkali literally means 'play of the tigers'.The folk art form is native to Kerala and is performed on the fourth day of Onam. Performers are painted like tigers and wear leopard or tiger masks. The feral dance is well-aided by rustic drum beats.The first women ‘tigers’ participated in the predominantly male Pulikkali in 2016.

Prisoners of taste: 'Food for Freedom' in Kerala jails


Prisons are hardly known for good food. But jails across Kerala are out to change that image. They sell food made by the inmates in the prison kitchens for a profit. Takeaway counters and sales vans sell the dishes and baked goods under the brand name “Food for Freedom”.The modest experiment started at the Central Prison in Thiruvananthapuram in 2010 to help jails live up to the ideal of correctional centres has spread to many more centres. The number of workers and counters and the variety on offer have grown. The prisons contribute ₹3 crore a year to the exchequer from food sales. After serving their terms, several cooks who cut their teeth at the “industrial prison canteens” make a living out of the skill they learnt behind bars.Targeted at low-income groups, the professionally packed ready-to-eat chapathis, biryanis and chicken curry are competitively priced. As if inflation has been arrested, the prices have not gone up for a long time. A chapathi costs ₹2 and a plate of chicken curry ₹20. Prison authorities say no preservatives or other chemicals are added. People crowd the outlets, prompting the government to open more of them.The one-off cafeteria in the Thiruvananthapuram prison is top-of-the-line with air-conditioning and ample parking space. The Kannur prison will get one such soon. Both will have Wi-Fi connectivity and mobile phone charging ports. The kitchens are being modernised to keep up with the demand. The authorities say the cooks are selected based on aptitude and medical fitness. The prison authorities keep a wage register, and on the request of the inmate, send money to the family.

Join the Dandiya revelry in Thiruvananthapuram



Dholi Taro Dandiya Night   | Photo Credit: 
CV Subrahmanyam
 If you love to swing to music, then this could be your time to let your hair down at Dholi Taro Dandiya Night.Wear your vibrant ethnic best and move gracefully in circles while keeping time with dandiya sticks to the tunes of Gujarati, Bollywood and DJ dandiya mix by DJ Akhil.According to Deepika Kamnani, an organiser of the dance event, it all started when Priyadarsini Premakumary posted a message on Her Trivandrum, a Facebook page in which Deepika is a member.“Priyadarshini, an NRI from the city, encouraged members of the group to organise a Dandiya night as a way to educate children about diverse festivals and celebrations in India,” says Deepika. Inspired by the positive response to the post, Deepika decided to set the ball rolling and Utsav, a committee, was formed comprising Priya Harikumar, Sujaya George, Gayatri S Ajith, Sonali Kamnani, Athira Gopinathan, Shailja Sreekumar and Deepika herself. “There’s quite a lot of work to be done in such a short time, right from finding sponsors to the event, to getting a permit from the City Corporation to organising the clean-up post the event. We were fortunate in finding a venue for the programme with ease as Devi Mohan, a member of Her Trivandrum and vice-chairman of Saraswathy Vidyalaya, magnanimously offered the Saraswathy Vidyalaya school grounds to hold the Dandiya night.” Although Dandiya nights are a norm in many places in India during the Navaratri season, it’s celebrated on a small scale in the city. “The North Indian community in the city, especially the Gujaratis, organise a nine-day garba dance at a mandapam at East Fort every year during Navaratri. It is, however, perhaps for the first time that a garba is open to all communities and held on such a large scale in the city,” says Deepika.Priya says that the dandiya is easy to perform and does not have complicated moves. “Also, we have members who will be leading the dance floor. The euphoria is evident as a few have shared videos of simple dance moves in a WhatsApp group we have formed for our guests. People want to perfect the styles of dandiya and garba and present an immaculate performance during the event,” says Priya. Tickets to the event are priced at ₹300 for adults and ₹250 for children between the ages of three and 10. Men, women and children have to come dressed in ethnic wear. Dandiya sticks will be provided at the venue. There will be food stalls and an interesting line-up of games at the venue. The event is at Saraswathy Vidyalaya, Vattiyoorkavu, on October 6. Time: 4 pm to 10 pm. Buy tickets at the venue or contact 8934677150

‘Manoharam’ revolves around an artist dealing with the changing times, says director Anvar Sadik



Director Anvar Sadik   | Photo Credit: 
Special Arrangement
 Writer-director Anvar Sadik’s Manoharam, set to hit the marquee today (September 27), zooms in on the life of an individual left “outdated” in a fast-changing world against the backdrop of “a modern-day village.”“Manoharam revolves around the story of Manoharan, played by Vineeth Sreenivasan, a painter and design artist striving to cope with the changing times. Fondly called Manu, he’s a purist at heart. Though talented, he feels the world has overtaken him. Not willing to give up and reposing faith in his own gifts, he sets about proving his worth,” narrates Anvar over phone from Chennai.Manoharan is inspired by his deceased father, himself a design artist in the film. “The popularity of easy-to-learn design software such as Adobe Photoshop puts a technophobe like Manu out of employment. The rest of the plot is about his endeavour to “stay updated”, says Anvar, not wanting to divulge more. “It is a feel-good drama peppered with humour and romance,” the director adds.The Palakkad native says the movie evolved from his observation of lives and sketches familiar to him. “I have seen people like Manoharan around me. I think even the idea of villages has changed, with technology bridging rural and urban life to a large extent. So the script germinated from this seed of observation and I have promptly tried to capture the traits of such characters and their lives in the film. About 90% of the events depicted is perhaps inspired by real events. As the backdrop was clear in my mind, I was confident about breathing life into it on screen,” says Anvar, who scripted the film.Anvar says Manoharam is set and shot in some bucolic locations in Palakkad, mainly in and around Nenmara. “We have tried to capture all the trappings associated with a modern-day village in Kerala. That amount of research is reflected in the script,” he explains.Manoharam is the 40-year-old’s second film, having previously directed Vineeth in the 2014 romantic musical Ormayundo Ee Mugham, inspired by the Hollywood rom-com 50 First Dates based on the theme of anterograde amnesia. On associating with Vineeth again, Anvar says he felt “the subject” perfectly fit the actor. “It also helped that we have known each for a long time now and hence share a good rapport on sets. Also, from my Ormayundo Ee Mugham experience, I had an idea as to how Vineeth would be in front of the camera,” he says.Others in the cast include actor-director Basil Joseph, who plays Manoharan’s bosom buddy, Indrans as Varghes ettan, Hareesh Peradi, Jude Anthany Joseph, Deepak Parambol and Nandini Nair, while Aparna Das, who essayed a minor role in Njan Prakashan, plays the protagonist’s love interest. Cinematography is by Jebin Jacob. Sanjeev T, who formerly played the guitar for AR Rahman, has composed the songs.Anvar says that after his first project, he did take his time to shape his craft better, explaining the five-year gap between his two films. “Looking back, I do admit that my début was done in a bit of a hurry (laughs). And I think it perhaps showed the shortcomings of a newbie. This time, I wanted to bide my time and chisel out the project. The taste and sensibilities of the Malayali audience have changed. I have also been waiting for a good story,” he explains.So what’s ‘beautiful’ about Manoharam? “Mainly, the down-to-earth characters any Malayali can relate to.

  | Photo Credit: B. VELANKANNI RAJ  The much-awaited vehicle scrappage policy that has gone for a Cabinet approval is likely to see stringent registration and fitness norms for pre-2005 manufactured vehicles, according to sources.As per estimates, there are about 2 crore pre-2005 built vehicles that are plying on Indian roads and the move is aimed at de-incentivising such vehicles in view of about 10 to 25 times higher pollution emission by them under the new emission norms.Last week, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said that he had cleared a Cabinet note on the proposed policy and a decision is expected on it soon.

New vehicle scrappage policy may need tinkering
Indian vehicle market has grown exponentially. If old pollution norms are compared with new emission regulations, pre-2005 vehicles are polluting 10 to 25 times more under the new norms, sources said. Even if those old vehicles are maintained properly, they will be polluting more with more emissions and will prove to be a hazard for road safety.“The proposed policy may see imposition of certain compliances like increased registration charges for private vehicles and increased fitness certification charges for transport vehicles... There may be provisions in the proposed policy to de-incentivise such vehicles,” the sources added.Given the proposed stringent norms that include fitness certificate requirement every year for transport vehicles, a significant number of such vehicles will certainly opt for vehicle scrapping, they said.Besides, the government is also planning for a mechanism for a safe disposal system for pollutants that include AC-CFC — a liquid refrigerant composed of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), that are found to emitting greenhouse gases which harms the ozone, according to the sources.The policy may also contain mechanism to deflate airbags scientifically besides disposal of noble metals in the silencer and rubber etc parts in an eco-friendly manner.“The oil ECT just can’t be thrown on earth. These should be disposed of scientifically,” the source said.The policy, if finalised, may have provisions that on scrapping of old vehicles, buying new vehicles could be given concessions by dealers on the basis of certificates of vehicle scrapping, the sources said.In two years time, the ministry is planning to create automated fitness regime in which no manual intervention would be required to check corruption.Last week, Mr. Gadkari said: “I have signed the file for the cabinet note on the policy for the scrapping of old vehicles. The finance ministry has approved the note on it.”He said the note will now be circulated to ministries concerned and the Cabinet was likely to take a call on it soon.He had added that the proposed policy once approved will be applicable on all vehicles including two and three-wheelers.Earlier, the policy had gone for a fresh round of consultation with the stakeholders on the direction of the PMO.The minister had earlier said that once the policy is approved India could emerge as a hub for automobile manufacturing as key raw material available from scrapping like steel, aluminium and plastic are bound to be recycled, bringing down automobile prices by “20-30 per cent%”

Clear vendor dues by October 15, PSUs told 


Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman   | Photo Credit: Sandeep Saxena The government on Saturday set October 15 as the deadline for central public sector units to clear overdue payments to vendors and exhorted them to front-load capital expenditure, as it looks to lift economic growth from a six-year low.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who reviewed capital spending programmes with heads of 32 Maharatna and Navratna Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), said the state-owned companies have been asked to front-load investment for the second half of the current fiscal.CPSEs have been asked to submit a road map for the next four quarters by October 15, she said after the meeting. “It was decided that all pending dues to be cleared by October 15 and by October 15, they will have a portal through which all dealers and contractors shall start monitoring their payment,” Ms. Sitharaman said.“Meeting [will be held] with the RBI and the Finance Secretary and select number of CPSEs to talk about why bank guarantees are becoming a big hitch or hurdle in government paying up the 75% post arbitration awards. If that is the case, then I will seek RBI’s help,” she said. Also, the CPSEs have been asked to detail the lifespan of arbitrations that lock payments after disputes with vendors and contractors, she said.The Minister stressed that capital expenditure (capex) needed to be given a vigorous push in the next two quarters. CPSEs must ensure that regular payments are cleared expeditiously as it spurs the investment cycle, and must establish the e-billing portal for enabling stakeholders to track the status of payments, she said. She added that special efforts must be made to clear dues of MSMEs and resolve cases on the SAMADHAN portal of the Department of MSME. Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar said that 34 central PSUs have already spent ₹48,077 crore till August, and have detailed spending of another ₹50,159 crore till December 2019. An additional ₹54,700 crore would be spent in the January-March quarter. The expenditure plan is on track and companies have expressed their willingness to meet the target set for the current fiscal, he said.Expenditure Secretary Girish Chandra Murmu said the capex of all the 244-odd PSUs would be about ₹4 lakh crore for the current fiscal. Some agencies have come to the government for enhancing gross budgetary support to them and the call in this regard will be taken during the revised estimate meeting, he said. With regard to pending payments, Murmu said about Rs 55,000 crore has been cleared out of Rs 60,000 crore as on date. All out efforts are being made so that the investment is on track and there is no liquidity crunch, he added. Public procurement as a percentage of GDP in the country is estimated between 20 to 22 per cent. With the Indian economy at USD 2.7 trillion, this amounts to public procurement to the tune of USD 500 billion annually. CPSEs are a major contributor to public procurement of goods and services. The government has introduced performance-based evaluation and has also empowered the boards of maharatna and navratna companies for taking operational decisions. In a statement, the finance ministry said CPSEs should double their contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) and be the third major source of revenue for the Centre after direct and indirect taxes. They must also make efforts to reduce the country’s imports bill and expand India’s global strategic reach by 2022, it added. To improve transparency, a major transformation has taken place in the last few years in the way procurement is made in the government by setting up of the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) and the Central Public Procurement Portal. This allows procurement to take place in a completely paperless, cashless and system driven e-market with minimal human interface. The participating CPSEs presented their capex till August 2019 to the finance minister and explained their plans for the next two quarters. For example, ONGC has a capex plan of Rs 32,921 crore for 2019-20. Its capex till August 2019 was Rs 8,777 crore, which was 26.66 per cent of the total planned capex for the fiscal.
